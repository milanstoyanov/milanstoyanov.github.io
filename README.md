# Direct Air Capture

## Climate Technology and My Journey with it

### Direct Air Capture is the process of capturing carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere through exposure to a solid sorbent, which allows atmospheric CO₂ to be directly absorbed. One of these various methods, which I chose to learn more about and test in the lab myself, involves limestone, or calcium carbonate (CaCO₃).

#### Heirloom's Process

[Heirloom Carbon Technologies](https://www.heirloomcarbon.com/)  is a company that uses limestone for CO₂ removal. First, the limestone (CaCO₃) is heated to about 900°C in a reactor powered by renewable energy. This results in the following decomposition reaction caused by the desorption of CO₂ at this temperature: <br>

>CaCO₃ → CaO + CO₂ <br>

The products are CaO, or calcium oxide, and CO₂, or carbon dioxide. The CO₂ is then taken through a process known as carbon storage, where it is compressed and transferred through pipes into underground rock formations, resulting in safe storage. Heirloom then takes the CaO and, in a process known as hydration, combines it with water to form Ca(OH)₂, or calcium hydroxide:<br>

>CaO + H₂O → Ca(OH)₂ <br>

This process is also exothermic, allowing for energy recovery. Next, the Ca(OH)₂ is spread on trays and stacked to provide maximum reaction area while minimizing land requirements. The calcium hydroxide then reacts with ambient CO₂ in a step known as carbonation to reform calcium carbonate and capture the CO₂ in the air back into new limestone: <br>

>Ca(OH)₂ + CO₂ → CaCO₃ + H₂O <br>

The new calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) is then used again in the process. This cyclical nature of the process allows for efficient use of resources and limited costs of reactants.
